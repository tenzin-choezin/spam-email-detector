# Spam Email Classification

This project was created as a part of Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science using Python's Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries and Jupyter Notebook. In this project, I created a logistic regression classifier that distinguishes spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails using over 8000 training emails. This model achieved an accuracy of 95% when tested on a seperate set of 1000 emails.

The main objective of this project is to work and understand:
  - Feature engineering with text data
  - Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
  - Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
  - Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
